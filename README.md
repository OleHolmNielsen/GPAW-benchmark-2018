# GPAW-benchmark-2018

GPAW code building instructions and benchmark data
--------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this page is to document the building of the
[GPAW](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/) code version 1.4.
Subsequently a GPAW test and a GPAW benchmark run is documented.

We require using the [EasyBuild](https://github.com/hpcugent/easybuild)
software build and installation framework that allows you to manage
(scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems
in an efficient way.
These instructions are based upon EasyBuild version 3.6.1.

In order to have a well-defined and reproducible software modules framework 
for the purpose of comparing benchmark results obtained on different systems,
we require the use of specific software module toolchains 
provided by EasyBuild version 3.6.1.
Future versions of EasyBuild will contain newer toolchains in addition to
the ones used in the present instruction.

The benchmark requires to build the GPAW code using one or both of the following 
EasyBuild software module toolchains:

1. foss-2018a: BLACS, FFTW, GCC, OpenBLAS, OpenMPI, ScaLAPACK

2. iomkl-2018a: OpenMPI, icc, ifort, imkl

The foss toolchain uses only Open Source software,
whereas the iomkl toolchain requires licensed Intel C and Fortran compilers 
as well as the Intel MKL library.

Step 1: Installing Lmod
-----------------------

A software modules tool is a prerequisite, and the recommended tool is
[Lmod](https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/research-development/tacc-projects/lmod).

Brief Lmod installation instructions for CentOS 7 may be found in
https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/EasyBuild_modules#install-lmod.
The root superuser may install the Lmod RPM by:

```
yum install epel-release
yum install Lmod
```

A non-root user can install Lmod as documented in http://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installing-Lmod-without-root-permissions.html

Step 2: Installing EasyBuild
----------------------------

EasyBuild must be installed as a normal user.

NOTICE: EasyBuild by default builds binary application codes which are optimized 
for the host/node CPU architecture.  Therefore all software must be built on the 
same type of CPU architecture that the software will eventually run on.
If you build software on an older CPU architecture, the code will only use CPU instructions
available on the old CPU architecture, and hence potentially be mush slower 
than it should be!

The CPU architecture may be printed using the command:
```
gcc -march=native -Q --help=target | grep march
```
This information is only available with the GCC compiler version 4.9 and newer.
Also the ```lscpu``` will reveal information about the type of CPU.

Brief EasyBuild installation instructions for CentOS 7 may be found in
https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/EasyBuild_modules.
There is an official
[EasyBuild installation](https://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) 
guide with detailed instructions.

Define the top-level directory and modules tool for your modules, for example:

```
mkdir $HOME/modules
export EASYBUILD_PREFIX=$HOME/modules
export EASYBUILD_MODULES_TOOL=Lmod
```
where $HOME is the normal user's home directory.

Download and install EasyBuild:

```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcugent/easybuild-framework/develop/easybuild/scripts/bootstrap_eb.py
python bootstrap_eb.py $EASYBUILD_PREFIX
```

Update the $MODULEPATH by module use, 
then load the EasyBuild module and check the basic EasyBuild functionality:

```
module use $EASYBUILD_PREFIX/modules/all
module load EasyBuild
module list
eb --version
```

Step 3: Build the foss-2018a toolchain
--------------------------------------

EasyBuild version 3.6.1 (and later) contains the foss-2018a toolchain
which is used to build GPAW.
The foss toolchain contains the following modules:

```
BLACS, FFTW, GCC, OpenBLAS, OpenMPI, ScaLAPACK
```

To build the foss-2018a toolchain run this command:

```
eb foss-2018a.eb -r
```

The building of GCC, OpenMPI and FFTW will be particularly time consuming,
and this task may take several hours!

Now the foss toolchain modules can be loaded:

```
$ module load foss/2018a
$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) GCCcore/6.4.0
  2) binutils/2.28-GCCcore-6.4.0
  3) GCC/6.4.0-2.28
  4) numactl/2.0.11-GCCcore-6.4.0
  5) hwloc/1.11.8-GCCcore-6.4.0
  6) OpenMPI/2.1.2-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  7) OpenBLAS/0.2.20-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  8) gompi/2018a
  9) FFTW/3.3.7-gompi-2018a
 10) ScaLAPACK/2.0.2-gompi-2018a-OpenBLAS-0.2.20
 11) foss/2018a
```

Step 4: Build the iomkl-2018a toolchain (optional)
--------------------------------------------------

EasyBuild version 3.6.1 (and later) contains the iomkl-2018a toolchain
which is used to build GPAW.
The iomkl toolchain contains the following modules:

```
OpenMPI, icc, ifort, imkl
```

The Intel compilers icc and ifort, and the MKL library, are products
offered by Intel.
We do not require the use of Intel MPI.

There are useful hints about Intel compiler installation and licenses in the web page
https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/EasyBuild_modules#intel-compiler-toolchains

Specify your Intel <license-server> host port 28518 (for example) or just the 
license file path:

```
export INTEL_LICENSE_FILE=28518@<license-server>
export INTEL_LICENSE_FILE=<file-path>
```

To build the iomkl-2018a toolchain first download the compiler tar-ball files
as described in 
https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/niflheim/EasyBuild_modules#intel-compiler-toolchains
and move these files to the EasyBuild source directories.

```
mkdir -p $HOME/modules/sources/i/icc $HOME/modules/sources/i/ifort $HOME/modules/sources/i/imkl
mv parallel_studio_xe_2018_update1_composer_edition_for_cpp.tgz $HOME/modules/sources/i/icc/
mv parallel_studio_xe_2018_update1_composer_edition_for_fortran.tgz $HOME/modules/sources/i/ifort/
mv l_mkl_2018.1.163.tgz $HOME/modules/sources/i/imkl/
```

Due to a bug in the Intel compilers 2018.1 you need to set a very large or unlimited
stack size before building Python 3.x with Intel compilers, for example:

```
ulimit -s 40000000
ulimit -s unlimited
```
See details in https://software.intel.com/en-us/forums/intel-c-compiler/topic/759078.
The bug seems to have been resolved in the Intel 2018.3 compiler version.

Then run this command to build the iomkl toolchain:

```
eb iomkl-2018a.eb -r
```

If Mellanox libraries are installed on the system, building of OpenMPI may fail.
The workround is to disable UCX in the OpenMPI configuration,
see details in https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs/pull/5949.
Then build OpenMPI with:
```
eb --from-pr 5949 OpenMPI-2.1.2-iccifort-2018.1.163-GCC-6.4.0-2.28.eb
```

Now the iomkl toolchain modules can be loaded:

```
$ module load iomkl/2018a
$ module list

Currently Loaded Modules:
  1) GCCcore/6.4.0
  2) binutils/2.28-GCCcore-6.4.0
  3) icc/2018.1.163-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  4) ifort/2018.1.163-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  5) iccifort/2018.1.163-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  6) numactl/2.0.11-GCCcore-6.4.0
  7) hwloc/1.11.7-GCCcore-6.4.0
  8) OpenMPI/2.1.2-iccifort-2018.1.163-GCC-6.4.0-2.28
  9) iompi/2018a
 10) imkl/2018.1.163-iompi-2018a
 11) iomkl/2018a
```

Build GPAW using the foss-2018a toolchain
-----------------------------------------

The GPAW 1.4 package is not yet part of the EasyBuild official releases.
A subdirectory ```easyconfigs``` contains the EasyBuild files required to 
build GPAW 1.4.

Build the GPAW, GPAW-setups and ASE software modules by:
```
eb GPAW-1.4.0-foss-2018a-Python-3.6.4.eb -r easyconfigs
```
